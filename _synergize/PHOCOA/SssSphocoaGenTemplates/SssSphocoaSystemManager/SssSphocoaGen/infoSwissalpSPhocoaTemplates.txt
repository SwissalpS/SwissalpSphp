PHOCOA written by Alan Pinstein
This is part of a PHOCOA template structure or part of a PHOCOA app that
was built using such a template. (structure compiled by SwissalpS)

using a script based on SssSphocoaGenerator php class
in terminal
cd to the dir where you want your PHOCOA app
run 'newSssSphocoaProject' or whatever you call a script containing:
<? require('SssSphocoaGenerator.inc');
SssSphocoaGenerator::makeNewSssSphocoaProject(true);
?>
the parameter 'true' indicates to use all defaults. leave out to be asked
interaktively from which template to copy and to set values for all the options
such as base paths for the config


needs updating....the functionality has evolved way beyond this....
