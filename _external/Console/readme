This file is provided "as is".  Use it at your discretion and I hope it helps you out.

The concept is pretty basic, it is a simple PHP class that takes entries and loads them into a separate window. If you create two instances, you obviously get two windows so you can separate your console lists if you like. 

<?php
	$console = new Console('My Console');
	$console->setDebugMode($is_in_debug_mode); // nothing happens if this is set to false
	$console->rec('Something');
	$console->rec('Something else');
	
	$console->printConsole();
	
?>

If you make modifications, I'd appreciate if you sent it my way.
